# Altex Website Testing
- I managed to complete all the planned tests
- During testing, there were no difficulties or problems with the test environment
- The time of entire project was carried out for 1 day, an average of 8 hours 
- I chose Registration and Login functions for testing and tried to create the best test cases for these 2 functions
- I didn't limit myself only to Functional Test cases and tried to write Security and UI ones (giving my knlowledge and technology limitations I only created a few ones)
- I also tried writing Performance Testing in Jmeter but failed at it, there was a reccurent error showing up and couldn't figure out the problem so far
