# Altex Website Testing
As part of the project, I tested features such as:
- Registration
- Login

# Test Cases
- The test cases were written in TestRail based on the specifications and application.
- The Test Cases are divided into Functional, Security, UI and Performance ones

# Bug Reports
- All the errors I found were reported and described in the JIRA tool and exported all to a PDF file

# Test Reports
- Test case reports are produced in the TestRail tool and saved in a PDF file

# Performance Testing
- I tried exercising Performance Testing in JMeter
- There were some errors testing this web page and couldn't figure out the problem

# Envirnoment
- Windows 10 Pro - Google Chrome - 4G Wi-fi


I managed to complete all the planned tests


During testing, there were no difficulties or problems with the test environment


The time of entire project was carried out for 1 day, an average of 8 hours 

I didn't limit myself only to Functional Test cases and tried to write Security, UI and Performance ones (giving my knlowledge and technology limitations I only created a few ones)
